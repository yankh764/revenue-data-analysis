## Considerations on Newer Tooling (Optional)

This optional task invited thoughts on potentially using newer tools like dbt, Airflow, and Snowflake for parts of the revenue pipeline.

My professional background is primarily in backend engineering, specifically developing web services for data integration systems and focusing on practical database design. Through this work, I've gained direct experience in structuring data, ensuring data integrity during transfers, and managing the flow of information between different systems – challenges that are central to this assignment.

While I haven't used dbt, Airflow, or Snowflake directly in past projects, I can see how they aim to solve common problems encountered in data pipelines:
* Tools like **Airflow** seem designed to reliably schedule and monitor sequences of data tasks, which is critical for any automated data process.
* **dbt** appears focused on bringing software engineering practices (like version control and testing) to the SQL transformation steps that happen *after* data is loaded, helping to organize the logic involved in preparing data for reporting – something essential for maintainability.
* Platforms like **Snowflake** represent modern approaches to building scalable and flexible data warehousing.

Understanding how these specific tools streamline these processes is definitely something I'm keen to explore further. This challenge has been a great motivator in highlighting their potential benefits.

However, to ensure I could thoroughly complete the core data analysis and propose concrete improvements to the current pipeline within the assignment's scope (Tasks 1 and 2), I decided to focus my efforts there. Consequently, I haven't included a detailed migration plan using these specific tools in this submission.

I'm confident that my hands-on experience designing databases and building the backend logic for data integration provides a practical foundation for quickly learning and applying these newer data engineering tools effectively.
